The basic idea is to remove all stones in a column once it is filled and add a permanent stone (black border) on the bottom. This stone has the color of the player who had more stones in the column and will not be removed. Once I came up with the idea I realized that I could simply build it with react.js - and here it is. Have fun playing :)"
